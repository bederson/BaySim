BaySim
======

DataBay hackathon project


Derived from a CS class on teaching programming in python, this simcity style game adds a realistic map of the 
Cheseapeake Bay and allows you to study the interplay of water levels, pollution and a crab population as a measure
of the health of the ecosystem.

Written in python, the code should simply by either "import ui" from the python prompt, or by issuing the comment

python ui.py
