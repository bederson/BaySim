it's a game!   (more to come)


Some technical background:

1) We first had to find a (raster based) dataset that describes the
elevations in both land and sea, and had to combine and calibrate
separate sea and land dataset.

2) The "simcity" style code that runs the simulation was adapted from
a UMD class teaching students python ...  (fix this up).  The code
next needed to be adapted to add pollution sources and a crab
population to show the effect of population. In addition the water
levels can also be tuned to study the effect of rising sea levels.
